The app can be run from the terminal with python by running 'python3 app.py'

The app is then launched on the server and can be interacted with by using an
API client like Postman to make requests and read the responses.

The /user endpoint can be used to create users using the POST method and can
also be used to get information on users like their names and unique ID's.

The /mood endpoint can be used to submit a logged in user's mood rating and
also get a user's past mood ratings. I also shows a user's current streak.

The /login endpoint is where a user logs in with their credentials.
